## 0.1.0
### Minor Changes

- c4cb321: Use web dev server in test runner. This contains multiple breaking changes:
  
  - Browsers that don't support es modules are not supported for now. We will add this back later.
  - Most es-dev-server config options are no longer available. The only options that are kept are `plugins`, `middleware`, `nodeResolve` and `preserveSymlinks`.
  - Test runner config changes:
    - Dev server options are not available on the root level of the configuration file.
    - `nodeResolve` is no longer enabled by default. You can enable it with the `--node-resolve` flag or `nodeResolve` option.
    - `middlewares` option is now called `middleware`.
    - `testFrameworkImport` is now called `testFramework`.
    - `address` is now split into `protocol` and `hostname`.
